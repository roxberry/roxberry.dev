Speaker: Jennifer Radke

[DAMA Philadelphia](https://dama-phila.org/index.php) hosts five full day chapter meetings per year, every other month from September through May. There are additional professional development opportunities, such as instructor led training, seminars and certification camps. These special events are priced separately at a discounted rate. Networking functions are held after select meetings and events.

Please join us for our September virtual meeting -- Thursday, Sept 17th.

We will dive into a timely topic -- data quality and making sense of the information flow that surrounds us on social media, in the time of COVID-19!

During a global pandemic -- data collection, quality, and privacy are ever-important. We are constantly faced with emerging studies, health guidelines, and news reports that aim to interpret these new findings; and there are reports that this social media platform (or that one) is misusing our personal data to influence voter decisions or healthcare practices. How do we know what to believe?

9:00 am -- Welcome, DAMA Philadelphia chapter introduction and updates

9:15 am -- Sponsor presentation -- available

9:30 am -- Feature Presentation -- Data Quality in Social Media
