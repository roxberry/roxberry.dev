# Building an App
Design, Plan, Code and Ship a SwiftUI app and blog about it

- Define the App
- Pick the Technologies
- Give the App a home
- Design the App
- Create an MVP and Roadmap
- Code It
- Test It
- Ship It

## Define the App
Next Wars RPG (NWRPG) is a turn based, decision making role playing game in the Next Wars Multiverse.  The game can be played by remote players and AI players, with a human or non-human Game Master.  NWRPG will have a player builder, story builder, world builder and a lore builder in the toolkit feature.  Content can be player created or subscription.  Player created content will be gamified to manage resources and story integration.

## Pick the Technologies
NWRPG is going to be a Swift app, so obviously Swift (5.5).  I'll try AWS Amplify for a first release - Cognito, DynamoDB, API, S3.  Not sure about the DataStore component.

## Give the App a home
NWRPG will live in a private GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/un2tech/nw-swift) for the initial MVP release.  The planning and design repo is [here](https://github.com/un2tech/NextWars/projects/1).

## Design the App
Stay tuned.
