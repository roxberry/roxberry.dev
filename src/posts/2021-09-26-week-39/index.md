## Week 39 Retrospective

Overall feel - last week was a grind.  Despite that all my projects are green, SJSL went well on Sunday and not a complete disaster, the week in totality felt like a drag.  A few negatives outweighed the positives, hopefully I can flip the script in week 39.

Busy, busy, busy.  I started the week with a plan.  It was a week full of all kinds of interactions beyond the Slack window and I ended it with a great feeling of many doors opening.

1. Back to School - I visited my children's school and learned about their daily process.  I definitely miss the classroom environment. 
1. Project delivery - I delivered one of the major last projects for my client, I assumed ownership of it after my colleague's contract expired.  It was a good delivery, no major issues.
1. Dependency hell - changes to the back end of one of our systems required changes on the integration calls, just a configuration change, but it was not communicated to the team.  Resolved it, good to go.
1. Injury - [Haglund’s Deformity and Chronic Achilles Tendonitis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1048666618300211) - less pain this week, able to visit a client.
1. Client and potential client meetings all went well for me.  Interesting and substantive work at each.  Prompting me to finish my AWS certification path.
1. Had a colleague team meeting to discuss client calls.  It was a good way to hear different points of view, 10,000 down to 1 inch (figuratively) ideas.
1. [Roll20 MarkUn2](https://app.roll20.net/users/9580215/markun2) Damien has a secret mission, shhh.
