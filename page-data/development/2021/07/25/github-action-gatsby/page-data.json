It works just fine and is reliable when everything is set up on my machine.  The package.json includes the deploy script:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">  \"scripts\": {\n      ...\n    \"deploy\": \"gatsby build --prefix-paths &#x26;&#x26; gh-pages -d public\"\n  },\n</code></pre>\n<p>However, there are 2 drawbacks for my workflow (and my goal to start writing more):</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You can deploy without a commit and push to the repository</li>\n<li>You can't deploy without running the deploy script, so any work on the site on Github or my iPad won't get deployed until I commit and push on one device and then pull and deploy to the same repo on my computer.  Ain't nobody got time for that.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I was using a Github Action for my Jekyll site, prior to moving to Gatsby, and that worked when I pushed to branch and kickoff the publish action.  This action was a bit more involved as I was using Azure for a host and it required a few more configuration hurdles to set it up.</p>\n<p>For my current site, I thought it has to be pretty simple - push to main branch, trigger an action, copy to gh-pages branch and that's that.  Turns out, that is that and I was able to get it working pretty fast.</p>\n<p>I documented my steps in case I need to go back and change anything - e.g. I would like to update the siteMetadata.version in the gatsby-config.js file at some point.  Here are the steps</p>\n<h2>Steps to publish a Gatsby site to gh-pages</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Create a new workflow in the repository Actions section</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">name: Gatsby Publish\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      main\n\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v1\n      - uses: enriikke/gatsby-gh-pages-action@v2\n        with:\n          access-token: ${{ secrets.ACCESS_TOKEN }}\n          deploy-branch: gh-pages\n</code></pre>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>\n<p>Create a personal access token (PAT), select the <em>repo</em> permission.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/authentication-in-a-workflow\">Authentication in a Github Action Workflow</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Create a Secret in the repo: ACCESS_TOKEN and use the new PAT token (note the workflow YAML file specifies the ACCESS_TOKEN parameter).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Build should kick in and go green</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Profit?</p>\n<p>And lo and behold, my site is passing (hopefully this shows it's passing):\n<a href=\"https://github.com/roxberry/gatsby-roxberry/actions/workflows/main.yml\"><img src=\"https://github.com/roxberry/gatsby-roxberry/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg\" alt=\"Gatsby Publish\"></a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Next things</h2>\n<ul class=\"contains-task-list\">\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> Improve this post with images from Github</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> Add embedded gist for the main.yml</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> Config version update (need to think about - should only happen on non posts)</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> Create a tweet with the title if a post</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- <script src=\"https://gist.github.com/roxberry/f6f58e2212346fd8c699c1d8c8cf8bcf.js\"></script>\n{% gist f6f58e2212346fd8c699c1d8c8cf8bcf %} -->"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/development/2021/07/25/github-action-gatsby/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1460613570","2052298874","2446865869","717330468"],"slicesMap":{}}
