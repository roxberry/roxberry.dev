Out of my comfort zone, this involved a hotel stay at the Inn at Leolas, a new client with a barrage of new concepts and code.  I was issued a new laptop, new e-mail, new MSDN account - more stuff to manage.  I did utilize a Google Chrome feature of setting up a Chrome profile for the new account.  This let me setup a profile with bookmarks, applications and settings specific to the account I will use at the client.</p>\n<h1>Performance Testing</h1>\n<p>I am following a basic process for performance testing:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Understand client issues that prompted their request for a specialist.</li>\n<li>Identify target environments to test</li>\n<li>Create test environment to plan and design tests</li>\n<li>Plan and design tests</li>\n<li>Execute tests and capture results</li>\n<li>Analyze results</li>\n<li>Write report, include approach, results and recommendations</li>\n<li>Present findings and recommendations</li>\n</ol>\n<h1>Command</h1>\n<p>I started a project for a server to run on my robot kits using <a href=\"https://www.dexterindustries.com/gopigo/\">GoPiGo</a> as a prototype.  Find it on Github, <a href=\"https://github.com/roxberry/command\">command</a>.  I ran into issues with the node-gopigo module, may need to write an interface and stub it out to work on the services code off robot.</p>\n<h1>SecureWorld Philadelphia</h1>\n<p>I was approved and registered to go to <a href=\"http://events.secureworldexpo.com/details/philadelphia-pa-2017/\">SecureWorld Philadelphia</a> in April.  I also signed up for the \"Designing and Building a Cybersecurity Program Based on the NIST Cybersecurity Framework\" training option.  While <a href=\"https://www.waveseeker.com/DSI/\">Database Solutions</a> may not directly implement a Cybersecurity framework, I consider it critical that we understand what our clients are building.</p>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/technology/2017/02/12/technology-briefing/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1460613570","2052298874","2446865869","717330468"],"slicesMap":{}}
