The game can be played by remote players and AI players, with a human or non-human Game Master.  NWRPG will have a player builder, story builder, world builder and a lore builder in the toolkit feature.  Content can be player created or subscription.  Player created content will be gamified to manage resources and story integration.</p>\n<h2>Pick the Technologies</h2>\n<p>NWRPG is going to be a Swift app, so obviously Swift (5.5).  I'll try AWS Amplify for a first release - Cognito, DynamoDB, API, S3.  Not sure about the DataStore component.</p>\n<h2>Give the App a home</h2>\n<p>NWRPG will live in a private GitHub repository <a href=\"https://github.com/un2tech/nw-swift\">here</a> for the initial MVP release.  The planning and design repo is <a href=\"https://github.com/un2tech/NextWars/projects/1\">here</a>.</p>\n<h2>Design the App</h2>\n<p>Stay tuned.</p>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/technology/2021/07/04/building-an-app/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1460613570","2052298874","2446865869","717330468"],"slicesMap":{}}
