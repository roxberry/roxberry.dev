I started the week with a plan.  It was a week full of all kinds of interactions beyond the Slack window and I ended it with a great feeling of many doors opening.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Back to School - I visited my children's school and learned about their daily process.  I definitely miss the classroom environment.</li>\n<li>Project delivery - I delivered one of the major last projects for my client, I assumed ownership of it after my colleague's contract expired.  It was a good delivery, no major issues.</li>\n<li>Dependency hell - changes to the back end of one of our systems required changes on the integration calls, just a configuration change, but it was not communicated to the team.  Resolved it, good to go.</li>\n<li>Injury - <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1048666618300211\">Haglund’s Deformity and Chronic Achilles Tendonitis</a> - less pain this week, able to visit a client.</li>\n<li>Client and potential client meetings all went well for me.  Interesting and substantive work at each.  Prompting me to finish my AWS certification path.</li>\n<li>Had a colleague team meeting to discuss client calls.  It was a good way to hear different points of view, 10,000 down to 1 inch (figuratively) ideas.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://app.roll20.net/users/9580215/markun2\">Roll20 MarkUn2</a> Damien has a secret mission, shhh.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Week 40 Outlook</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Project - consolidate ECOM flow steps</li>\n<li>New Appliance install</li>\n<li>Tires</li>\n<li>AWS Certification Class</li>\n<li>SJSL Jim Miller Cup Event Setup</li>\n<li>CPEs from CodeRed</li>\n<li>Project for SJSL -> Schedule Manager</li>\n<li>Project for SJSL -> SJS1</li>\n<li>Wednesday Night Gaming</li>\n<li>Home fixes - new blinds, nail punch</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>References</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-professional/\">AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional</a></li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Ру́сский WOTDs this week</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>хохота́ть/захохота́ть: to laugh out loud</li>\n<li>краси́вый: beautiful</li>\n<li>беспла́тный: free</li>\n<li>а́нгел: angel</li>\n<li>го́рько: bitterly</li>\n<li>шк сожале́нию: unfortunately</li>\n<li>и́мя: name</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Image credit</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/xFjti9rYILo\">Engine Block by Garett Mizunaka</a></p>\n<h3>Quote credit</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/demosthenes_128803?src=t_great\">BrainyQuote</a></p>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/planning/2021/09/26/week-39/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1460613570","2052298874","2446865869","717330468"],"slicesMap":{}}
