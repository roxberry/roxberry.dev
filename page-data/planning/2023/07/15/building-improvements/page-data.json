Taking a look at some things that I want to work on in the near future, I realized that I could use markrox.dev as a project hub.</p>\n<h3>Just Added</h3>\n<p>I added a projects section on the home page and for projects, I designed a project card widget.  I have more than 4 projects, so I selected 4 as featured for the home page and will add others to a projects page.</p>\n<p>I added an About Me page - still working on what I want there, just used my short bio from a conference where I gave a security presentation. Still pondering what other things to include.</p>\n<p>And I enabled my Contact Me page, despite get a bit of random spam e-mails. I'll watch for an uptick in nonsens e-mails and decide to keep enabled or not.</p>\n<h3>In Planning</h3>\n<p>I need a mobile navigation widget that will show the new navigation links on smaller devices, resolutions under 768px.</p>\n<p>I would like to data drive the featured projects and all projects, will need to see how to do that via Gatsby.</p>\n<p>Review what I should have on an About Me page, what will interest others, not just myself.</p>\n<p>Design and develop a better tag manager, possibly use a search tool for the local list of tags.</p>\n<h2>Image Credit</h2>\n<p>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/ja/@dianamia?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">C Dustin</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/construction?orientation=landscape&utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></p>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/planning/2023/07/15/building-improvements/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1460613570","2052298874","2446865869","717330468"],"slicesMap":{}}
